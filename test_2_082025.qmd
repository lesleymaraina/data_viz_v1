## <span style="font-size:80%">Why Data Visualization Matters in Clinical and Biomedical Research?</span> {.smaller}

<br>
**Turning Complexity into Clarity**


::: incremental
- Biomedical research produces massive, multidimensional datasets (genomics, imaging, electronic health records, clinical trials)
- Raw tables or statistics are often too overwhelming. Visualization reduces complexity and highlights patterns, trends, and anomalies
- Presenting data correctly can help save lives

<br>
**Turning Complexity into Clarity**

**Facilitating Discovery**


::: incremental
- Plots can reveal relationships that aren’t obvious in numbers
- Clinical Example: visualizations help detect outliers, biases, or early warning signals of treatment effects

**Turning Complexity into Clarity**

**Facilitating Discovery**

**Improving Communication Across Disciplines**

::: incremental
- Researchers, clinicians, patients, and policymakers need to interpret findings
- A clear figure (Kaplan–Meier survival curve, forest plot, heatmap, dashboard chart) can communicate results instantly across audiences

**Turning Complexity into Clarity**

**Facilitating Discovery**

**Improving Communication Across Disciplines**

**Supporting Reproducibility and Trust**

::: incremental
- Transparent figures allow others to verify results and see how conclusions were drawn
- Poor or misleading visualizations (e.g., truncated axes, exaggerated differences) have historically misinformed clinical practice

<br>
Effective dashboards lead to significant positive improvements in outcomes. For example, some reductions in mortality, costs, and length of stay in multiple studies 


::: incremental
- 73% reduction for 30-day mortality rate [Zygourakis, C., et. al (2017). JAMA Surgery]
- Patient length of stay in hospital, a proxy for service quality and effectiveness, was reduced [Jung, A., et. al. (2018). Journal of Surgical Research.]

<br>
Data visualizations reduce hospital costs


::: incremental
- Cost reductions ranged from \$160000 (USD) in annual hospital operating room expenditure for gastric bypass surgeries to$10.7 million (USD) in the cost of total knee surgery in another hospitals [Rocchio, BJ. (2016)]

Survey of 3387 articles in 15 high-profile journals showed errors in data visualization $\rightarrow$ downstream error

::: incremental
- Bars that don’t start the y-axis at zero 
- Bars drawn on logarithmic axes (or from log-transformed data) that lack a meaningful zero baseline
  - Log-scale increase distortion

Recap: Why data visualization matters

- In biomedical/clinical work, visualizations turn: 
  - high-dimensional data into insight—supporting discovery
  - clearer cross-disciplinary communication (e.g.,heatmaps, dashboards)
  - Potential for transparency/reproducibility
  
- Potential to save lives and reduce cost
  - clinical dashboards were associated with improved outcomes

- Ineffective data visualizations can distort meaning and can contribute to harmful decisions
